# Phonebook

Simple project, that uses only the C++ standard library. 

## Platform

Ubuntu 20.04, GCC 9.4.0

## Organization and usage

The **types** directory contains source code for custom types. All types have unit tests written for them (in plain C++). To build them use an appropriate build script (.sh). The name of the script corresponds to the type name, except in the script it is in camel case and the directory with code is in snake case.
